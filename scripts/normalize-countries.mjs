/**
 * normalize-countries.mjs
 *
 * Rewrites country / registration_country values stored as ISO or MARC codes
 * (KR, IO, TU, CAU, XXK ...) as English country names. See lib/country-codes.mjs
 * for why: the site reads two-letter values as ISO, which misplaces MARC codes.
 * Codes that cannot be placed with confidence are left as they are and listed.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/normalize-countries.mjs            # dry run
 *   node scripts/normalize-countries.mjs --write    # apply
